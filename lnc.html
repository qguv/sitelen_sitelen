  <h1>Reflection: Language and Culture</h1>
  <h2>Quint Guvernator</h2>

  <p>
  Our section on research ethics, specifically with respect to <em>linguistic
  gratuity</em> and <em>research debt encurred</em>, really resonated with me.
  I feel strongly that specialists in any field ought to use their skills to
  try to improve quality of life however they can.
  </p>

  <p>
  I have been interested in updating and improving the linguist's toolbox ever
  since I first considered combining linguistics and computer science. For me,
  a big part of <em>language and culture</em> is the ability to recognize the
  linguistic needs of a community.

  <p>
  In lieu of a purely reflective piece, I have tried to put into action (in a
  very small way) my ideals by creating an experimental piece of software to
  properly render a particularly challenging class of script. Please see
  <a href="index.html">the project description</a>
  for more details.
